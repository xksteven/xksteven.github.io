### Professional History
**Autobon AI** *Head of AI* __Auguest 2019 to September 2020__  
	Developed the AI/ML infrastructure at Autobon, which involves designing data ingestion into Amazon AWS, constructing labeling tasks, and quality assurance over the labeled data.
	**aws**

**Google Brain** *Research Intern* __May 2018 to September  2018__  
	Researched the area of Fact Checking related to this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3184558.3188723) and developed solutions to deal with the problem of content abuse and contributed with the Google News team.
	**python, pytorch, tensorflow, apache-beam, flume**

**Here Maps** *Research Intern* __May 2017 to September 2017__  
	Engineered models to better estimate time of arrival (ETA), and also improved lane level navigation prediction.
	**python, pytorch**

**Here Maps** *Research Intern* __May 2016 to September 2016__  
	Developed a model that creates road probability maps that can be used to detect differences between artificial maps and the real roads.
	**python, tensorflow**

**University of Miami** *Undergraduate Project*  __May 2012 to September 2014__  
	Created a genetic therapy via transducible gene editing proteins with Dr. Richard Myers.  Involves running western blots, gel electrophoresis, transductions, PCR, and electroporation.

### Projects

* **Multilabel OOD Detection**  
	[multilabel-ood](https://github.com/xksteven/multilabel-ood)  
	Evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) techniques on multilabel classification tasks.

* **Sparse Hypercolumns**  
	[sparse hypercolumns](https://github.com/xksteven/Sparse-Hypercolumns)  
	Makes an interface for creating memory efficient sparse hypercolumns.  Used in automatic colorization and classification.

* **OpenGL Renderer**  
	[myRenderer](http://www.github.com/xksteven/myOpenGl)  
	I created a simple OpenGL renderer to render some height maps and draw some objects.  Applies simple lighting and texturing.

* **BattleShip game over internet**  
	[BattleShip](https://github.com/xksteven/Networks)  
	I created a simple Battleship game in C that has a client, server interface.

### Publications
**[Aligning AI With Shared Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02275)** __In Submission__  
	Created a new benchmark to evaluate AI Safety by measuring how well models agree with human values.

**[Many Faces of Robustness: An Analysis of Out-of-Distribution Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16241)** __In Submission__  
	Collected a new dataset and introduced a new technique which achieves state of the art on out of distribution detection.

**[A Benchmark for Anomaly Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11132)** __In Submission__  
	Constructed a synthetic dataset and utilize pre-existing datasets to evaluate different techniques for Anomaly Segmentation.  We also showed how some classic approaches can improve performance in this task.

**[Natural Adversarial Examples](https://sites.google.com/view/icml2019-generalization/accepted-papers)** __ICML 2019 Workshop__  
	Constructed a dataset which captures long tail distributions to highlight where current models fail in terms of generalization.

**[DIODE: A Dense Indoor and Outdoor DEpth Dataset](https://diode-dataset.org)** __2019__  
	Utilized a single depth sensor to capture both indoor and outdoor scenes to create the most accurate depth dataset to date.  

**[Analysis of Generative Adversarial Models](https://newtraell.cs.uchicago.edu/files/ms_paper/xksteven.pdf)** __2017__  
	Introduce a novel measure for quantitatively assessing the quality of generative models and presented a method for utilizing GANs to interpret classifiers.
