## Finding Good ML Papers to Read

This will be a short post to hopefully get me to write and post more often.  I have mostly found it quite a struggle as time goes by to find more relevant papers to read.  The reasons are plenty there is less free time for me to read now than as a graduate student and possibly the other bigger reason there are many many more publications now than there used to be in the areas I care about.  See [nice plot here](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2019/all-adversarial-example-papers.html) of number of adversarial examples publications approaching an exponential function over a short period of time.

## Sources I use for finding top papers to read or review

* [ML Safety Newsletter](https://newsletter.mlsafety.org) AI safety newsletter by Dan Hendrycks.
* [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com) Papers and code ranked either by github stars or by social media.
* [https://papers.labml.ai/papers/weekly/] Not entirely sure who runs this but it fetches tweets to rank papers by most discussed.

### Sources I want to check out

* [Alignment newsletter](https://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter/) alignment newsletter by Rohin Shah formerly at [CHAI](https://humancompatible.ai) and currently at Deepmind as of the time of writing.
* [Import AI](https://jack-clark.net) Worked on by Jack Clark co-founder of Anthropic talks about different aspects of AI not neccessarily all research related.
* [Davis Summarizes Papers](https://dblalock.substack.com) Written by Davis Blalock is a research scientist at MosaicML who worked on optimizing ML algorithms.
* [Deep Learning Weekly](https://www.deeplearningweekly.com) Written mostly be Mikhail Franco Planas who studied industrial engineering and works exclusively on this website as a writer/editor.

### AI News and Politics

* [Last Week in AI](https://lastweekin.ai) A relatively community run newsletter.  Most prominent writers are a Andrey Kurenkov Standford student and Daniel Bashir a compiler engineer.
* [EuropeanAI newsletter](https://us19.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=eaeece823e606d2458a568db9&id=b32cc2b876) Covers AI policy in Europe mostly.
