### Research Interests

My current research in computer science is in the field of computer vision.  I am working on the problem of visual question answering where the task can be described as given both an image and a question to produce a correct answer.  Most of my research currently involves the use of machine learning and deep learning methods.

### Experience

**Here Maps** *Research Intern* __Summer 2016__  
	I developed a model that creates road probability maps that can be used to detect differences between artificial maps and the real roads.
	**python, tensorflow**

### Projects

* **OpenGL Renderer**  
	[myRenderer](http://www.github.com/xksteven/myOpenGl)  
	I created a simple OpenGL renderer to render some height maps and draw some objects.  Applies simple lighting and texturing.

* **BattleShip game over internet**  
	[BattleShip](https://github.com/xksteven/Networks)  
	I created a simple Battleship game in C that has a client, server interface.
