## Managing Procrastination by Treating the Source

It turns out procrastination is mostly mismanagement of emotions.  So being able to handle or manage your emotions can lead to better outcomes and less procrastination.  I've struggled with this on a variety of fronts which stem from feelings of imposter syndrome and the like. I'm writing this mostly for myself but hopefully someone else can benefit from it too.

The other important thing to note is that it takes 6 weeks of following the steps below to show results.  This is according to the published literature.  I recently started the practice by doing a few but will be incorporating all into my routines and note the progress as I go.

Here are the 7 steps to emotion regulation (as developed by Matthias Berking) also known as Affect Regulation Training (ART).

### The Seven Skills

Skills (or steps to take):

1. Take a deep breath and calm you're breathing
2. Relax your muscles
3. Observe situation, thoughts, and emotions
4. Acceptance and tolerance
5. Compassionate self support
6. Analysis of emotions
7. Modifying distressing emotions

#### Notes on the skills

The skills or steps should be done in order and can be modified after 6 weeks. Also note that the first three steps try to help out the now and immediate feelings while the last four are more longer term behavioural changes.  It can be the case where even if you become calm and observe etc you can face the emotions head on and want to veer away and possibly for good reasons as when you've previously felt those feelings before it works to avoid them (i.e. avoid danger).  However the last 4 skills work to reframe the danger sensations to not feel as dangerous. 

#### Breathing and Relaxation

This is kind of self explanatory as to what to do.  Although it does take practice to do it well.  It's not always easy to notice which muscles are tense or if you're breathing is fast or erratic.

Beyond that it is important to note that the way your body is responding to the environment (internal or external) can act as a viscous cycle.  You worry about the project, your muscles tense, having tense muscles implicitly causes more stress on body and mind, which causes more worry, and it repeats.

#### Observation

Allow the feelings you're having.

You do not need to identify with your thoughts.


#### Acceptance

#### Analysis (and Modification) of Emotions

### Official list (if curious)

I believe these are the official practices below:

- Mindful Awareness 
- Cognitive Reappraisal
- Acceptance of Emotions
- Self-Compassion
- Relaxation Techniques
- Imagery Techniques
- Goal-Oriented Behavior

Here's also a short blurb about each one.  

#### Mindful Awareness 

This involves paying attention to one's emotional state in a non-judgmental and accepting way, allowing individuals to notice emotions as they arise without immediately reacting.

#### Cognitive Reappraisal

This technique helps individuals change the way they interpret or think about a situation, leading to a different emotional response. It involves reframing negative thoughts to reduce their emotional impact.

#### Acceptance of Emotions

Rather than avoiding or suppressing difficult emotions, this approach encourages individuals to accept them as part of the human experience, reducing the emotional struggle.

#### Self-Compassion

This involves treating oneself with kindness and understanding when experiencing emotional distress, rather than being overly self-critical or harsh.

#### Relaxation Techniques

These include methods like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization exercises to reduce physical tension and emotional arousal.

#### Imagery Techniques

Positive imagery involves creating mental pictures of soothing or pleasant scenes, which can help shift focus away from distressing emotions and promote calmness.

#### Goal-Oriented Behavior

This technique involves focusing on actions that align with one's long-term goals and values, rather than being driven by short-term emotional impulses.
