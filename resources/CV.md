### Research Interests

My primary area of focus has been within computer vision.  For the years of 2015-2017, I have worked on generative models, specifically GANs, coming up with both a measure and a method to use GANs to interpret other classifiers.  I have since begun exploring techniques to make models more robust. The majority of my research focuses on applications of machine learning.

### Research Experience

* **Computer Science**  __2014 to current__  
	I am working with Dr. Greg Shakhnarovich at TTIC in the areas of machine learning and computer vision.

* **Biochemistry**   __2011 to 2014__  
	I worked with Dr. Richard Myers at the University of Miami trying to create a generic genetic therapy via transducible gene editing proteins.  I ran western blots, gel electrophoresis, transductions, PCR, and electroporation

### Experience

**Google Brain** *Research Intern* __Summer 2018__  
	I worked in NLP and collaborated with several teams.  I worked in the area of Fact Checking related to this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3184558.3188723) to deal with the problem of content abuse and also worked with the Google News team.
	**python, pytorch, tensorflow, apache-beam, flume**

**Here Maps** *Research Intern* __Summer 2017__  
	I worked on models to better predict arrival times (ETA estimates) and lane level navigation prediction which can be used for autonomous vehicles.
	**python, pytorch**

**Here Maps** *Research Intern* __Summer 2016__  
	I developed a model that creates road probability maps that can be used to detect differences between artificial maps and the real roads.
	**python, tensorflow**

### Projects

* **OpenGL Renderer**  
	[myRenderer](http://www.github.com/xksteven/myOpenGl)  
	I created a simple OpenGL renderer to render some height maps and draw some objects.  Applies simple lighting and texturing.

* **BattleShip game over internet**  
	[BattleShip](https://github.com/xksteven/Networks)  
	I created a simple Battleship game in C that has a client, server interface.

### Publications

**[A Benchmark for Anomaly Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11132)** __In Submission__
        In this work we both construct a synthetic dataset and utilize pre-existing datasets to evaluate different techniques for Anomaly Segmentation.  We also show how some classic approaches can improve performance in this task.

**[Natural Adversarial Examples](https://sites.google.com/view/icml2019-generalization/accepted-papers)** __ICML 2019 Workshop__  
	In this work we construct a dataset which captures long tail distributions to highlight where current models fail in terms of generalization.

**[DIODE: A Dense Indoor and Outdoor DEpth Dataset](https://diode-dataset.org)** __2019__  
	In this work we use a single depth sensor to capture both indoor and outdoor scenes to create the most accurate depth dataset to date.  

**[Analysis of Generative Adversarial Models](https://newtraell.cs.uchicago.edu/files/ms_paper/xksteven.pdf)** __2017__  
	This is my master's work in which I introduce a novel measure for quantitatively assessing the quality of generative models and present a method for utilizing GANs to interpret classifiers.
