**[HarmBench: A Standardized Evaluation Framework for Automated Red Teaming and Robust Refusal](https://www.harmbench.org/)** **ICML 2024**

**[Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency](https://www.ai-transparency.org/)**

**[Testing Robustness Against Unforeseen Adversaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08016)**
    
**[Do the Rewards Justify the Means? Measuring Trade-Offs Between Rewards and Ethical Behavior in the MACHIAVELLI Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03279)** **ICML 2023**
    We created a benchmark to evaluate agent decision making and try to evaluate paths.  I contributed to a few of the benchmarks but mostly worked to coordinate, plan, and manage resources. 

**[How Would The Viewer Feel? Estimating Wellbeing From Video Scenarios](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/75ff01252ab45ce278cb060effce4ca1-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html)**  **NeurIPS 2022**
    Reevaluated the results and ran additional experiments for submission and rebuttal periods.

**[Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Real-World Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11132)** **ICML 2022**  
    Constructed a synthetic dataset and utilized pre-existing datasets to evaluate different techniques for Anomaly Segmentation.  We also showed how some classic approaches can improve performance in this task.  

**[Measuring Coding Challenge Competence With APPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09938v3)** **NeurIPS 2021**  
    Collected and created an evaluation benchmark for converting word problems and tasks into python code. The evaluation framework consisted of taking abitrary python code and running it to compare against ground truth solutions.  

**[Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving With the MATH Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874)**  **NeurIPS 2021**  
    Creating functions that can generate arbitrary math problems to evaluate models for different grade levels of math competency.  

**[Aligning AI With Shared Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02275)** **ICLR 2021**  
    Created a new benchmark to evaluate AI Safety by measuring how well models agree with human values.  

**[Towards Robustness of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15188)** **Thesis 2021**  
    Thesis consisting of the previous work in robustness, and trying to make few-shot models robust.

    Collected a new dataset and introduced a new technique which achieves state of the art on out of distribution detection.  

**[Natural Adversarial Examples](https://sites.google.com/view/icml2019-generalization/accepted-papers)** **ICML 2019 Workshop**  
    Constructed a dataset which captures long tail distributions to highlight where current models fail in terms of generalization.  

**[DIODE: A Dense Indoor and Outdoor DEpth Dataset](https://diode-dataset.org)** **2019**  
    Utilized a single depth sensor to capture both indoor and outdoor scenes to create the most accurate depth dataset to date.  

**[Analysis of Generative Adversarial Models](https://newtraell.cs.uchicago.edu/files/ms_paper/xksteven.pdf)** **2017**  
    Introduce a novel measure for quantitatively assessing the quality of generative models and presented a method for utilizing GANs to interpret classifiers.
